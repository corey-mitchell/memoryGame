# Gorillaz Memory Game

## Description

A simple, but addictive, Gorillaz centered memory game built using React.

**Instructions** - Try to click on every Gorillaz picture once. When you click a picture, the grid will automatically shuffle. The goal of the game is click all 12 pictures once despite the shuffled grid. If you click any picture twice, the game will reset and you must begin again!
